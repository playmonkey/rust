Rust - (Smart contract development for Solana et al)

Rust has been gaining popularity in blockchain development, particularly for smart contracts, due to its focus on safety, concurrency, and performance. Here are some prominent blockchain platforms that support Rust for smart contract development:

1. Solana:
   - Solana is one of the most notable blockchains using Rust for smart contracts.
   - It uses Rust for both its core protocol and smart contracts (called "programs" in Solana).
   - Solana's programming model is designed to take advantage of Rust's safety and performance features.

2. Near Protocol:
   - Near supports smart contracts written in Rust.
   - It compiles Rust to WebAssembly (Wasm) for execution on the Near blockchain.
   - Near also offers an AssemblyScript option for developers more comfortable with JavaScript-like syntax.

3. Polkadot:
   - While Polkadot itself doesn't run smart contracts, parachains in the Polkadot ecosystem can support Rust-based smart contracts.
   - Substrate, the framework used to build Polkadot and its parachains, is written in Rust.
   - Many Polkadot parachains, like Astar and Acala, support Rust for smart contract development.

4. Concordium:
   - Concordium is a blockchain focusing on regulatory compliance and identity.
   - It supports smart contracts written in Rust, which are then compiled to Wasm.

5. Secret Network:
   - Secret Network, focused on privacy-preserving smart contracts, supports contracts written in Rust.
   - These contracts are compiled to Wasm and can operate on encrypted data.

6. Internet Computer:
   - Developed by Dfinity, the Internet Computer supports "canisters" (their term for smart contracts) written in Rust.
   - It also supports other languages that can compile to WebAssembly.

7. Oasis Network:
   - Oasis, a privacy-focused blockchain platform, supports smart contracts written in Rust.

8. Nervos CKB:
   - Nervos allows developers to write smart contracts in any language that can compile to RISC-V instructions, including Rust.

9. Holochain:
   - While not a traditional blockchain, Holochain supports developing distributed applications ("hApps") using Rust.

10. Cosmos ecosystem:
    - Some chains in the Cosmos ecosystem support Rust for smart contract development, especially those built with the CosmWasm framework.

The ecosystem is rapidly evolving, and more platforms are likely to adopt Rust for smart contract development due to its advantages in terms of safety and performance.
